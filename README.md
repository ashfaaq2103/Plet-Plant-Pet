# Plet

Plet is a small robotic system designed to engage children with plants through interactive emotions displayed on a screen. It detects human presence using a camera and also recognises faces using pictures uploaded on its web page. It also processes natural language using an API and displays various preset faces on a screen based on what the user has said. 

It makes use of an arduino mega, an arduino uno and a raspberry pi 4. The raspberry pi is used to process input from the sensors obtained by the arduino board and send signals back to the arduino boards to aactiviate actuators/motors.
